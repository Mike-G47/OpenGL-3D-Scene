# OpenGL-3D-Scene

**How do I approach designing software?**<br>

When designing software, I break problems into smaller parts and plan how each class will interact. In this project, I focused on creating organized systems for managing shaders, textures, and materials in my 3D scene. I improved my ability to design modular code that’s easy to update and reuse. I followed an iterative design process—starting simple, testing, and adding complexity gradually. This approach will help me in future projects by keeping code structured and easier to debug.

**How do I approach developing programs?**<br>

I develop programs incrementally, testing each change before moving on. For this 3D scene, I used trial and error to fine-tune materials, lighting, and transformations. Iteration was key to improving both the code and visuals. Over time, I became more strategic about planning and debugging, which made my workflow smoother and my code cleaner.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**<br>

Computer science helps me think critically and solve problems creatively. Working with computational graphics has given me skills in visual programming, shader logic, and object-oriented design. These skills apply not only to game or simulation development but also to data visualization and software engineering in general.
